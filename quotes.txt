"Buy some sweets or go to the Pictures,"
"stingy"
"Sixpennoth of Gooseberry Eyes,"
"Hello!"
"Gotter bit of money this mornin',"
"Good-bye, Father. Do not think of what you have done. I forgive you,"
"You young ruffian,"
"what do you mean by charging into me like that?"
"I wasn't chargin', Father,"
"I was only jus' comin' in at the gate, same as other folks. I jus' wasn't looking jus' the way you were coming, but I can't look all ways at once, cause----"
"Be _quiet_!"
"What's that on your tongue! Put your tongue out."
"How many times am I to tell you,"
"that I won't have you going about eating filthy poisons all day between meals?"
"It's not filthy poison,"
"It's jus' a few sweets Aunt Susan gave me 'cause I kin'ly went to the post office for her an'----"
"Be _quiet_! Have you got any more of the foul things?"
"They're not foul things,"
"They're good. Jus' have one, an' try. They're jus' a few sweets Aunt Susan kin'ly gave me an'----"
"Be _quiet_! Where are they?"
"Hello!"
"Hullo, Joan,"
"Have you missed me while I've been away?"
"Didn't know you'd been away,"
"What are you talking so funny for?"
"I'm not talkin' funny,"
"I can't help talkin' like this."
"You've got a cold. That's what you've got. That's what Mother said when she saw you splashing about with your rain tub this morning. She said, 'The next thing that we shall hear of William Brown will be he's in bed with a cold.'"
"It's not a cold,"
"It's jus' the way I feel."
"What are you eating?"
"Gooseberry Eyes. Like one?"
"Go on. Take two--three,"
"But they're--dirty."
"Go on. It's only ord'nery dirt. It soon sucks off. They're jolly good."
"I say,"
"Did you say you'd missed me? I bet you didn't think of me as much as I did of you. I jus' bet you didn't."
"I say, William, does your throat hurt you awful, that you've got to talk like that?"
"A bit,"
"Oh, William!"
"Does it hurt all the time?"
"I don't talk much about it, anyway, do I?"
"Oh, William! Is it--is it your--lungs? I've got an aunt that's got lungs and she coughs and coughs,"
"and it hurts her and makes her awful bad. Oh, William, I do _hope_ you've not got lungs."
"I guess I have got lungs,"
"but I don't make a fuss about 'em."
"What does the doctor say about it?"
"He says it's lungs all right,"
"He says I gotter be jolly careful."
"William, would you like my new paintbox?"
"I don't think so. Not now. Thanks."
"I've got three balls and one's quite new. Wouldn't you like it, William?"
"No--thanks. You see, it's no use my collectin' a lot of things. You never know--with lungs."
"Oh, _William_!"
"Of course,"
"if I'm careful it'll be all right. Don't you worry about me."
"Joan!"
"That's Mother. Good-bye, William dear. If Father brings me home any chocolate, I'll bring it in to you. I will--honest. Thanks for the Gooseberry Eyes. Good-bye."
"Good-bye--and don't worry about me,"
"I'll do all I can for you,"
"I know you will,"
"That was Jack Morgan, wasn't it?"
"Yes,"
"He's going to propose to her next Sunday. He told me about it because I'm her best friend, and he wanted to ask me if I thought he'd any chance. I said I thought he had, and I said I'd try and prepare her a little and put in a good word for him if I could. Isn't it thrilling?"
"Yes, dear. By the way, did you see William anywhere? I do hope he's not in mischief."
"He was in the front garden a minute ago."
"He's not there now, though."
"Mr. Brown,"
"Good afternoon,"
"I've come from Ethel."
"Yes?"
"Yes."
"She sent you this,"
"SHE SENT YOU THIS!"
"Yes? Er--very kind of her."
"Kinder keep-sake. Souveneer,"
"Yes. Er--any message?"
"Oh, yes. She wants you to come in and see her this evening."
"Er--yes. Of course. I've just come from her. Perhaps she remembered something she wanted to tell me after I'd gone."
"P'raps."
"Any particular time?"
"No. 'Bout seven, I expect."
"Oh, yes."
"You say she--sent this?"
"Yes."
"And no other message?"
"No."
"Er--well, say I'll come with pleasure, will you?"
"Yes."
"She thinks an awful lot of you, Ethel does."
"Yes? Kind--er--very kind, I'm sure."
"Always talkin' about you in her sleep,"
"I sleep in the next room and I can hear her talkin' about you all night. Jus' sayin' your name over and over again. 'Jack Morgan, Jack Morgan, Jack Morgan.'"
"Jus' like that--over an' over again. 'Jack Morgan, Jack Morgan, Jack Morgan.'"
"Are you--_sure_?"
"It might be someone else's name."
"No, 'tisn't,"
"It's yours. 'Jack Morgan, Jack Morgan, Jack Morgan'--jus' like that. An' she eats just nothin' now.  Always hangin' round the windows to watch you pass."
"It's--_horrible_,"
"She's got your photo,"
"fixed up into one of those little round things on a chain round her neck."
"Are--you--_sure_?"
"Sure's fate,"
"Well, I'd better be goin'. She pertic-ler wants to see you alone to-night. Good-bye."
"Good Lord,"
"How's your head, father?"
"Rotten!"
"Perhaps dinner will do it good,"
"it ought to be ready now."
"Mr. Morgan, mum. He wants to see Miss Ethel. I've shown him into the library."
"_Now?_"
"What the deu--why the dickens is the young idiot coming at this time of day? Seven o'clock! What time does he think we have dinner? What does he mean by coming round paying calls on people at dinner time? What----"
"Ethel, dear,"
"do go and see what he wants and get rid of him as soon as you can."
"Er--good evening, Miss Brown."
"Good evening, Mr. Morgan."
"Was it raining when you came, Mr. Morgan?"
"Raining? Er--no. No--not at all."
"I thought it looked like rain this afternoon."
"Yes, of course. Er--no, not at all."
"It does make the roads so bad round here when it rains."
"Yes."
"Er--very bad."
"Almost impassable."
"Er--quite."
"Is dinner to be kept waiting for that youth all night? Quarter past seven! You know it's just what I can't stand--having my meals interfered with. Is my digestion to be ruined simply because this young nincompoop chooses to pay his social calls at seven o'clock at night?"
"Then we must ask him to dinner,"
"We really must."
"We must _not_,"
"Can't I stay away from the office for one day with a headache, without having to entertain all the young jackasses for miles around."
"Oh----"
"I'll go, dear,"
"It's Mrs. Clive,"
"She says Joan has been very sick because of some horrible sweets William gave her, and she said she was so sorry to hear about William and hoped he'd be better soon. I couldn't quite make it out, but it seems that William has been telling them that he had to go and see a doctor about his lungs and the doctor said they were very weak and he'd have to be careful."
"But--why--on--earth?"
"I don't know, dear,"
"I don't know anything about it."
"He's mad,"
"Mad. It's the only explanation."
"He's gone,"
"Mother, it's simply horrible! He didn't tell me much, but it seems that William actually went to his house and told him that I wanted to see him alone at seven o'clock this evening. I've hardly spoken to William to-day. He couldn't have misunderstood anything I said. And he actually took a flower with him--a dreadful-looking rosebud--and said I'd sent it. I simply didn't know where to look or what to say. It was horrible!"
"Where _is_ William?"
"I don't know, but I thought I heard him go upstairs some time ago."
"He's insane,"
"stark, raving insane. You ought to take him to a doctor and get his brain examined. Look at him to-day. He begins by knocking me into the middle of the rhododendron bushes--under no provocation, mind you. I hadn't spoken to him. Then he tries to poison that nice little thing next door with some vile stuff I thought I'd thrown away. Then he goes about telling people he's consumptive. He looks it, doesn't he?  Then he takes extraordinary messages and love tokens from Ethel to strange young men and brings them here just when we're going to begin dinner, and then goes round burning and hacking at the doors. Where's the sense in it--in any of it? They're the acts of a lunatic--you ought to have his brain examined."
"It certainly sounds very silly, dear,"
"But there might be some explanation of it all, if only we knew. Boys are such funny things."
"William!"
"It's your bed-time, dear."
"Good night, Mother,"
"Good night, Father,"
"Don't think about what you've done, I for----"
"She's different from everybody else in the world,"
"You simply couldn't describe her. No one could!"
"_How's_ she different from anyone else?"
"Is she blind or lame or sumthin'?"
"Oh, go and play at trains!"
"A child like you can't understand anything."
"Yes, but who is she, dear?"
"Robert, I can't _think_ how you get these big holes in your heels!"
"I've _told_ you who she is, Mother,"
"I've been talking about her ever since I came into the room."
"Yes, I know, dear, but you haven't mentioned her name or anything about her."
"Well,"
"she's a Miss Cannon and she's staying with the Clives and I met her out with Mrs.  Clive this morning and she introduced me and she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she----"
"Yes,"
"you told me all that."
"Well,"
"we must have her to tea. I know I can't marry yet--not while I'm still at college--but I could get to know her. Not that I suppose she'd look at me. She's miles above me--miles above anyone. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.  You can't imagine her. You wouldn't believe me if I described her. No one could describe her. She----"
"I'll ask Mrs. Clive to bring her over one afternoon. I've no more of this blue wool, Robert. I wish you didn't have your socks such different colours. I shall have to use mauve. It's right on the heel; it won't show."
"You _can't_, Mother. How do you know it won't show? And even if it didn't show, the thought of it--! It's--it's a crisis of my life now I've met her. I can't go about feeling ridiculous."
"I say,"
"Are you spoony on her?"
"William, don't use such vulgar expressions,"
"Robert just feels a friendly interest in her, don't you, Robert?"
"'A friendly interest'!"
"No one ever _tries_ to understand what I feel. After all I've told you about her and that she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and miles above me and above anyone and you think I feel a 'friendly interest' in her.  It's--it's the one great passion of my life! It's----"
"Well,"
"I'll ring up Mrs. Clive and ask if she's doing anything to-morrow afternoon."
"Ellen can press the trousers of my brown suit to-night, can't she? And, Mother, could you get me some socks and a tie before to-morrow? Blue, I think--a bright blue, you know, not too bright, but not so as you don't notice them. I wish the laundry was a decent one. You know, a man's collar ought to _shine_ when it's new on. They never put a shine on to them. I'd better have some new ones for to-morrow. It's so important, how one looks. She--people _judge_ you on how you look. They----"
"I'll go and ring up Mrs. Clive now,"
"Mrs. Clive can't come,"
"but Miss Cannon will come alone. It appears she's met Ethel before. So you needn't worry any more, dear."
"_Worry!_"
"There's plenty to worry about still. What about William?"
"Well, what about him?"
"Well, can't he go away somewhere to-morrow? Things never go right when William's there. You know they don't."
"The poor boy must have tea with us, dear. He'll be very good, I'm sure.  Ethel will be home then and she'll help. I'll tell William not to worry you. I'm sure he'll be good."
"Hail, O great chief!"
"HAIL, O GREAT CHIEF!"
"Chief Red Hand,"
"And what death awaits the poor white face who has fallen defenceless into his hand?"
"You better come quiet to my wigwam an' see,"
"latest and most correct shape."
"dug-out."
"Here is the wigwam, Pale-face,"
"Stand here while I decide with Snake Face and the other chiefs what's goin' to be done to you. There's Snake Face an' the others,"
"That was Red Indian what I was talkin' then,"
"Snake Face says the Pale-face must be scalped and cooked and eat!"
"But me and the others say that if you'll be a squaw an' cook for us we'll let you go alive."
"Most humble and grateful thanks, great Red Hand,"
"I will with pleasure be your squaw."
"I've gotter fire round here,"
"That, O Squaw,"
"is a Pale-face we caught las' night!"
"Oh, how _lovely_!"
"Is he cooking?"
"I'll get you some feathers,"
"You oughter have feathers, too."
"This is jolly!"
"I love Red Indians!"
"I've got some cork you can have to do your face, too,"
"It soon burns in the fire."
"I'm afraid I'd better not,"
"Well,"
"now I'll go huntin' and you stir the Pale-face and we'll eat him when I come back. Now, I'll be off. You watch me track."
"A venison, O squaw,"
"Let it be cooked. I've had it out all morning,"
"they've not missed it yet."
"wigwam"
"Now,"
"here's some Pale-face for you, squaw."
"Oh,"
"I'm sure he's awfully good, but----"
"You needn't be frightened of it,"
"It's jolly good, I can tell you."
"It's jus' that and water and it's jolly good!"
"How lovely! Do they let you----?"
"They don't let me,"
"but there's heaps in the larder and they don't notice one every now an' then. Go on!"
"I don't mind you having it! Honest, I don't! I'll get some more soon."
"Gorgeous!"
"Crumbs! That's tea!"
"You don't keep a looking-glass in your wigwam I suppose?"
"N-no,"
"But I'll get one for next time you come. I'll get one from Ethel's room."
"Won't she mind?"
"She won't know,"
"I'm horribly late. What will they think of me? It was awful of me to come with you. I'm always doing awful things. That's a secret between you and me."
"Now come in and we'll confess."
"I can't,"
"I've got to wash an' come down tidy. I promised I would. It's a special day. Because of Robert, you know. Well _you_ know. Because of--Robert!"
"We _can't_ begin without her,"
"She'll think we're awful. It will--put her off me for ever. She's not used to being treated like that. She's the sort of girl people don't begin without. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever met in all my life and you--my own mother--treat her like this. You may be ruining my life. You've no idea what this means to me. If you'd seen her you'd feel more sympathy. I simply can't describe her--I----"
"I said four o'clock, Robert,"
"and it's after half-past. Ethel, tell Emma she can ring the bell and bring in tea."
"It's--the downfall of all my hopes,"
"Aren't I perfectly disgraceful?"
"To tell the truth, I met your little boy in the drive and I've been with him some time. He's a perfect little dear, isn't he?"
"Yes, I know Ethel and I met your son--_yesterday_, wasn't it?"
"Ought _I_ to have put on my best suit _too_?"
"Are you--er--fond of reading, Miss Cannon?"
"I--_wrote_ a tale once,"
"It was a jolly good one. I showed it to some people. I'll show it to you if you like. It began with a pirate on a raft an' he'd stole some jewel'ry and the king the jewels belonged to was coming after him on a steamer and jus' when he was comin' up to him he jumped into the water and took the jewls with him an' a fish eat the jewls and the king caught it an',"
"I'd love to read it!"
"What is your favourite flower, Miss Cannon?"
"I've gotter garden. I've got Virginia Stock grow'n all over it. It grows up in no time. An' must'erd 'n cress grows in no time, too. I like things what grow quick, don't you? You get tired of waiting for the other sorts, don't you?"
"Would you care to see the garden and green-houses, Miss Cannon?"
"I'd love to,"
"I LIKE THINGS WHAT GROW QUICK, DON'T YOU?"
"Can you tie knots what can't come untied?"
"No,"
"I wish I could."
"I can. I'll show you. I'll get a piece of string and show you afterwards. It's easy but it wants practice, that's all. An' I'll teach you how to make aeroplanes out of paper what fly in the air when it's windy. That's quite easy. Only you've gotter be careful to get 'em the right size. I can make 'em and I can make lots of things out of match boxes an' things an'----"
"These are my father's roses. He's very proud of them."
"They're beautiful."
"Well, wait till you see my Virginia Stock! that's all. Wait----"
"Will you have this tea-rose, Miss Cannon?"
"It--it--er--it suits you. You--er--flowers and you--that is--I'm sure--you love flowers--you should--er--always have flowers. If I----"
"An' I'll get you those red ones and that white one,"
"An' I'll get you some of my Virginia Stock. An' I don't give my Virginia Stock to _anyone_,"
"I hope--I hope,"
"I hope your stay here is a long one?"
"Well, why sha'n't I jus' _speak_ to her?"
"'Sh, dear!"
"I should like to show you some of the walks around here,"
"If I could have that--er--pleasure--er--honour?"
"I was only jus' _speaking_ to her,"
"I wasn't doin' any harm, was I? Only _speaking_ to her!"
"Is no one else ever to _speak_ to her."
"Jus' 'cause Robert's fell in love with her?"
"I must be going, I'm afraid,"
"You must come again some time,"
"I will,"
"I'm longing to see more of William. I adore William!"
"We've given William the slip,"
"He's no idea where we've gone even!"
"I'm sorry,"
"I'd have loved William to be here."
"You don't know him,"
"What a beautiful morning it is!"
"Am I walking too fast for you--Miss Cannon?"
"Oh, no."
"May I carry your parasol for you?"
"Oh, no, thanks."
"It can't be,"
"William!"
"My poor darling Red Hand!"
"Robert,"
"you really needn't look so upset."
"Upset!"
"You'd be upset if your life was ruined. You'd be upset. I've a _right_ to be upset."
"You're going there to tea,"
"Yes,"
"with other people. Who can talk with other people there? No one can. I'd have talked to her on the river. I'd got heaps of things ready in my mind to say. And William comes along and spoils my whole life--and my bicycle. And she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. And I've wanted that bicycle for ever so long and it's not fit to ride."
"But poor William has caught a very bad chill, dear, so you oughtn't to feel bitter to him. And he'll have to pay for your bicycle being mended.  He'll have no pocket money till it's paid for."
"You'd think,"
"you'd think four grown-up people in a house could keep a boy of William's age in order, wouldn't you? You'd think he wouldn't be allowed to go about spoiling people's lives and--and ruining their bicycles. Well, he jolly well won't do it again,"
"Robert,"
"you surely want to be at peace with your little brother, when he's not well, don't you?"
"_Peace?_"
"_Peace!_ I'll wait. I'll wait till he's all right and going about; I won't start till then.  But--peace! It's not peace, it's an _armistice_--that's all."
"Step out 'oo makes the noise,"
"I hope,"
"that they've taken away that infernal machine of yours."
"Then we may look forward to a little peace this evening?"
"Not that it matters to me, as I'm going out to dinner.  The only thing that relieves the tedium of going out to dinner is the fact that for a short time one has a rest from William."
"begged his way"
"Please----"
"If you're the new Boots,"
"go round to the back door. If you're not, go away."
"IF YOU'RE THE NEW BOOTS,"
"GO ROUND TO THE BACK DOOR."
"What y' want?"
"He said,"
"to come round if I was the new Boots."
"You bin round to the front?"
"Nerve!"
"Where's your things?"
"Comin',"
"Too tired to bring 'em with you?"
"All right.  Come in!"
"'Ere's the new Boots,"
"'is valet's bringin' 'is things later."
"Imperdent-lookin' child,"
"Now, then, Smutty,"
"none of your sauce!"
"'Ad your tea?"
"No,"
"All right. Sit down at the table."
"Learnt 'is way of eatin' at the Zoo,"
"When next you come a-hentering of this 'ouse, my boy,"
"kindly remember that the front door is reserved for gentry an' the back for brats."
"They're all the same,"
"Eat, eat, eat. Nothin' but eat.  Eat all day an' eat all night. 'E's not bin in the 'ouse two minutes an' 'e's at it. Eat! eat! eat! 'E'll 'ave all the buttons bust off his uniform in a week like wot the larst one 'ad. Like eatin' better than workin', don't you?"
"Yes, I do, too,"
"Well, if you've quite finished, my lord,"
"I'll show you to your room."
"Togs,"
"Your togs. Fix 'em on quick as you can. There's company to dinner to-night."
"You're smaller than wot the last one was,"
"They 'ang a bit loose. Never mind. With a week or two of stuffin' you'll 'ave most probable bust 'em, so it's as well to 'ang loose first.  Now, come on. 'Oo's bringing over your things?"
"E--a friend,"
"I suppose it _is_ a bit too much to expeck you to carry your own parcels,"
"in these 'ere days. Bloomin' Bolshevist, I speck, aren't you?"
"I'm a gold-digger,"
"Criky!"
"This 'ere is where you work, and this 'ere,"
"is where you live. You 'ave not,"
"the hentry into the servants' 'all."
"Crumbs!"
"You might has well begin at once,"
"there's all this lunch's knives to clean. 'Ere's a hapron, 'ere's the knife-board an' 'ere's the knife-powder."
"What do you think of 'im?"
"'E looks,"
"the sort of boy we'll 'ave trouble with."
"Not much clarse,"
"It surprises me 'ow any creature like a boy can grow into an experienced, sensible, broad-minded man like you, Mr. Biggs."
"Well,"
"as a boy, of course, I wasn't like 'im."
"I've done some of the knives,"
"shall I be doin' something else and finish the others afterwards?"
"'Ow many 'ave you done?"
"One or two,"
"well, two. But I'm feeling tired of doin' knives."
"You'll finish them knives, my boy,"
"or----"
"All right,"
"I'll finish the knives."
"'E's goin' to be a trile,"
"an' no mistake."
"Trile's 'ardly the word,"
"Haffliction,"
"That's more like it,"
"Wot time's supper?"
"You'd better go an' do your potatoes in the pantry,"
"and let's 'ave a bit of peace in 'ere and see 'e's doin' of 'is work all right."
"You'd be surprised,"
"if you knew what I really was."
"Go on!"
"What are you?"
"I'm a gold-digger,"
"I've got ship-loads an' ship-loads of gold. At least, I will have soon. I'm not goin' to give _him_,"
"any, nor any of them in there."
"Wot about me?"
"You,"
"shall have a whole lot of nuggets. Look here."
"You keep those and they'll be kind of tokens. See? When I come home rich you show me the buttons an' I'll remember and give you the nuggets. See? I'll maybe marry you,"
"if I've not married anyone else."
"'E's loony,"
"It's lovely listening to 'im talkin.'"
"company."
"I'M A GOLD DIGGER,"
"I'VE GOT SHIPLOADS AN' SHIPLOADS OF GOLD. AT LEAST, I WILL HAVE SOON."
"Wot was 'e doin'?"
"Nothin'--'cept talkin',"
"'E's a cure, _'e_ is,"
"If you've finished the knives,"
"there's some boots and shoes on the floor to be done. Brushes an' blacking on the shelf."
"Soup ready?"
"The company's just goin' into the dining-room--a pal of the master's. Decent-lookin' bloke,"
"Wot's 'appened to your buttons?"
"Come off,"
"Bust off,"
"I said so soon as I saw you. I said you'd 'ave eat your buttons bust off in a week. Well, you've eat 'em bust off in ten minutes."
"Eatin' an' destroyin' of 'is clothes,"
"It's all boys ever do--eatin' an' destroyin' of their clothes."
"Lawks!"
"someone's atorchurin' of the poor cat to death.  It'll be that blessed boy."
"If you let off that there thing once more, you little varmint,"
"I'll----"
"Did the new Boots arrive?"
"Yes,"
"Any good?"
"He doesn't seem to have impressed Biggs very favourably,"
"but they never do."
"The human boy,"
"is given us as a discipline. I possess one. Though he is my own son, I find it difficult to describe the atmosphere of peace and relief that pervades the house when he is out of it."
"I'd like to meet your son,"
"You probably will, sooner or later,"
"Everyone in the neighbourhood meets him sooner or later. He does not hide his light under a bushel. Personally, I prefer people who haven't met him.  They can't judge me by him."
"No answer,"
"Excuse me,"
"it's from my sister. 'I hope,' she read, 'that you aren't inconvenienced much by the non-arrival of the Boots I engaged for you. He's got "
"' But he's come,"
"A revolution, I expect,"
"The Reds are upon us."
"Good Lord!"
"it's _William_!"
"Oh, crumbs!"
"it's _father_!"
"It isn't _sense_,"
"If the interest on a hundred pounds for one year is five pounds,"
"William Brown, do sit up and don't look so stupid!"
"Well, I can't unner_stand_ any of it. It's enough to make anyone look stupid when he can't unner_stand_ any of it. I can't think why people go on givin' people bits of money for givin' 'em lots of money and go on an' on doin' it. It dun't seem sense. Anyone's a mug for givin' anyone a hundred pounds just 'cause he says he'll go on givin' him five pounds and go on stickin' to his hundred pounds. How's he to _know_ he will?  Well,"
"what's to stop him not givin' any five pounds once he's got hold of the hundred pounds an' goin' on stickin' to the hundred pounds----"
"William,"
"just listen to me. Now suppose,"
"suppose that Eric wanted a hundred pounds for something and you lent it to him----"
"I wun't lend Eric a hundred pounds,"
"'cause I ha'n't got it. I've only got 3½d., an' I wun't lend that to Eric, 'cause I'm not such a mug, 'cause I lent him my mouth-organ once an' he bit a bit off an'----"
"You'd better stay in after school, William, and I'll explain."
"Huh!"
"Now, William."
"You see, if someone borrows a hundred pounds from someone else----"
"Don't you _see_, William?"
"Yes, I see all about it now,"
"You've explained it all plain now. I cudn't unner_stand_ it before. It's a bit soft--in't it--anyway, to go lending hundred pounds about just 'cause someone says they'll give you five pounds next year. Some folks is mugs. But I do unner_stand_ now. I cudn't unnerstand it before."
"You'd have found it simpler if you hadn't played with dead lizards all the time,"
"Good Heavens!"
"What have I just been saying, William?"
"'Bout lendin' money?"
"William!"
"This isn't an arithmetic lesson. I'm trying to teach you about the Armada."
"Oh, _that_!"
"Oh, yes."
"Tell me something about it."
"I don't _know_ anything--not jus' yet----"
"I've been _telling_ you about it. I do wish you'd listen,"
"Every single flower has been stolen from the conservatory some time this morning,"
"We've only just been able to get the police. William, did you see any one about when you went to school this morning?"
"No,"
"No, Ethel, I didn't see nobody."
"Father,"
"s'pose I came to you an' said you was to give me a hundred pounds an' I'd give you five pounds next year an' so on, would you give it me?"
"I should not, my son,"
"I knew there was something wrong with it,"
"Father, what was the date of the Armada?"
"Good Heavens! How should I know? I wasn't there."
"Well, I'm tryin' to write about it and why it failed an'--why did it fail?"
"Father, what's the French for 'my aunt is walking in the garden'?"
"What on earth are you doing?"
"I'm doing my home-lessons,"
"I never even knew you had the things to do."
"No,"
"I don't generally take much bother over them, but I'm goin' to now--'cause Miss Drew"
"'cause Miss Drew"
"'c--cause Miss Drew"
"William's gone raving mad in the dining-room,"
"Takes the form of a wild thirst for knowledge, and a babbling of a Miss Drawing, or Drew, or something. He's best left alone."
"Father, what's the capital of Holland?"
"Good Heavens!"
"Buy him an encyclopedia. Anything, anything. What does he think I am? What----"
"I'd better set apart a special room for his homework,"
"now that he's beginning to take such an interest."
"A room!"
"He wants a whole house."
"I like pirates, don't you, Miss Drew? An' robbers an' things like that?  Miss Drew, would you like to be married to a robber?"
"No,"
"Nor a pirate?"
"No."
"They're quite nice really--pirates,"
"I think not."
"Well,"
"we'll jus' have to go huntin' wild animals and things. That'll be all right."
"Who?"
"Well--jus' you wait,"
"Would you rather be married by the Archbishop of York or the Pope?"
"The Archbishop, I think,"
"All right."
"Don't you think you ought to be going home, William?"
"Oh, no--not for ever so long yet,"
"Isn't it your bed-time?"
"Oh, no--not yet--not for ever so long."
"What does Miss Drew teach you at school, William?"
"Oh, jus' ornery things. Armadas an' things. An' 'bout lending a hundred pounds. That's a norful _soft_ thing. I unner_stand_ it,"
"but it's _soft_. My father thinks it is, too, an' he oughter _know_. He's bin abroad lots of times. He's bin chased by a bull, my father has----"
"You'd better go home now, William,"
"I don't mind comin' in a bit,"
"I'm not tired."
"William, where _have_ you been? I've been looking for you everywhere.  It's _hours_ past your bed-time."
"I was goin' a walk with Miss Drew."
"But you should have come home at your bed-time."
"I don't think she wanted me to go,"
"I think it wun't of bin p'lite."
"I'm very fond of syringa,"
"I'd love to have some."
"No, I ain't got no syringa. Please step off my rose-bed, Mister William. No, there ain't any syringa in this 'ere garding. I dunno for why. Please leave my 'ose pipe alone, Mister William."
"Huh!"
"Police! Help! Murder! Robbers!"
"Help! _Help!_ _Help!_"
"Hello! Who is it? What is it?"
"He was quite a small man, but with such an evil face. I just had one glimpse of him as he dashed past me. I'm sure he'd have murdered me if I hadn't cried for help. Oh, the coward! And a poor defenceless woman! He was standing by the silver table. I disturbed him at his work of crime.  I feel so upset. I shan't sleep for nights. I shall see his evil, murderous face. And a poor unarmed woman!"
"Can you give us no details, madam?"
"Could you recognise him again?"
"_Anywhere!_"
"Such a criminal face. You've no idea how upset I am. I might have been a lifeless corpse now, if I hadn't had the courage to cry for help."
"We're measuring the footprints, madam. You say he went out by the front door?"
"I'm convinced he did. I'm convinced he's hiding in the bushes by the gate. Such a low face. My nerves are absolutely jarred."
"We'll search the bushes again, madam,"
"but I expect he has escaped by now."
"The brute!"
"Oh, the _brute_! And that _face_. If I hadn't had the courage to cry out----"
"And he _dashed_ past me, dear. Quite a small man, but with such an evil face."
"I think you're _splendid_, dear,"
"How you had the _courage_."
"You'd better come in and rest, darling,"
"I'd better,"
"I do feel very ... shaken...."
"Where's William this evening?"
"I do hope he won't stay out after his bed-time."
"Oh, I've just met him,"
"He was going up to his bedroom. He was covered with hen feathers and holding a bunch of syringa."
"Mad!"
"Mad! mad! mad!"
"_Not_ syringa, William. I simply can't _bear_ the smell!"
"But you _said_ ... you _said_ ... you said you were fond of syringa an' that you'd like to have them."
"Did I say syringa?"
"I meant guelder roses."
"Hello!"
"I thought you did home lessons now?"
"I'm not goin' to take much bother over 'em now,"
"Miss Drew, she can't talk straight. She dunno what she _means_."
"That's always the trouble with women,"
"William says his idol has feet of clay,"
"I dunno as she's got feet of clay,"
"All I say is she can't talk straight. I took no end of trouble an' she dunno what she means. I think her feet's all right. She walks all right.  'Sides, when they make folks false feet, they make 'em of wood, not clay."
"Let's think of--sumthin' else to do--sumthin' quite fresh from what we've ever done before."
"Let's shoot things with bows an' arrows same as real outlaws used to,"
"What things?"
"What bows an' arrows?"
"Oh, anything--birds an' cats an' hens an' things--an' buy bows an' arrows. You can buy them in shops."
"We can make them,"
"Not like you can get them in shops. They'd shoot crooked or sumthin' if we made them. They've got to be jus' so to shoot straight. I saw some in Brook's window, too, jus' right--jus' same as real outlaws had."
"How much?"
"Five shillings--targets for learnin' on before we begin shootin' real things an' all."
"Five shillings!"
"We've not got five shillings. Henry's not having any money since he broke their drawing-room window an' Ginger only has 3_d._ a week an' has to give collection an' we've not paid for the guinea pig yet, the one that got into Ginger's sister's hat an' she was so mad at, an'----"
"Oh, never mind all that,"
"We'll jus' get five shillings."
"How?"
"Well,"
"grown-ups can always get money when they want it."
"How?"
"Oh--bazaars an' things,"
"Bazaars!"
"Who'd come to a bazaar if we had one? Who would? Jus' tell me that if you're so clever! Who'd come to it? Besides, you've got to sell things at a bazaar, haven't you? What'd we sell?  We've got nothin' to sell, have we? What's the good of havin' a bazaar with nothin' to sell and no one to buy it? Jus' tell me that!"
"Well--shows an' things,"
"Shows!"
"By Jove!"
"We _could_ do a show,"
"Get animals an' things an' charge money for lookin' at them."
"Who'd pay it?"
"Anyone would. You'd pay to see animals, wouldn't you?--real animals.  People do at the Zoo, don't they? Well, we'll get some animals. That's easy enough, isn't it?"
"Well, we'll have a show an' get money and buy bows an' arrows an' shoot things,"
"an we'll arrange the show next week."
"shows"
"Is she going to stay here for ever, or only for a few years? I'd like to know, because----"
"It's so nice to have her, dear."
"Have you slept well, Aunt?"
"Slept!"
"I hardly expect to sleep in my state of health. A little rest is all I can expect."
"Sorry you're no better,"
"_Better?_"
"It will be a long time before I'm better."
"I'm going to the post after tea,"
"Would you care to come with me?"
"You hardly expect me to go out in the evening in my state of health, surely? It's years since I went out after tea. And I was at the post office this morning. There were a lot of people there, but they served me first. I suppose they saw I looked ill."
"Though I must say,"
"this place does suit me. I think after a few months here I should be a little stronger. Pass the jam, William."
"I'm a bit over-tired to-day, I think,"
"I'm so apt to forget how weak I am and then I overdo it. I'm ready for the cake, William. I just sat out in the sun yesterday afternoon and sat a bit too long and over-tired myself. I ought to write letters after tea, but I don't think I have the strength. Another piece of cake, William. I'll go upstairs to rest instead, I think. I hope you'll keep the house quiet.  It's so rarely that I can get a bit of sleep."
"show"
"show"
"jus' a few friends"
"borrowed"
"Not a bad show for a penny, I _should_ say. I guess there aren't many like it, anyway. Do shut up talkin', Ginger. It'll spoil it all, if folks hear the giant talking out of his stomach. It's Douglas that's got to do the giant's _talking_. Anyone could see that. I say, they're comin'! Look! They're comin'! Along the wall!"
"White rat from China, ladies an' gentlemen, pink an' blue striped. All rats is pink an' blue striped in China. This is the only genwin China rat in England--brought over from China special las' week jus' for the show. It lives on China bread an' butter brought over special, too."
"Wash it!"
"Jus' wash it an' let's see it then."
"Wash it?"
"It's gotter be washed.  It's washed every morning an' night same as you or me. China rats have gotter be washed or they'd die right off. Washin' 'em don't make no difference to their stripes. Anyone knows that that knows anything about China rats, I guess."
"Wild cat,"
"Look at it! Kill anyone if it got out! Spring at their throats, it would, an' scratch their eyes out with its paws an' bite their necks till its teeth met. If I jus' moved away that chair it would spring out at you."
"and I bet some of you would be dead pretty quick. It could have anyone's head right off with bitin' and scratchin'. Right off--separate from their bodies!"
"Garn! It's Smuts. It's your sister's cat!"
"Smuts!"
"I guess there wouldn't be many of us left in this house if Smuts was like this."
"A giant,"
"Real giant. Look at it. As big as two of you put together. How d'you think he gets in at doors and things? Has to have everything made special. Look at him walk. Walk, Ginger."
"By Jove!"
"Go on,"
"That's not walkin'."
"If you go on talkin' at me, I'll drop him. I'm just about sick of it."
"All right,"
"Anyway it's a giant,"
"A jolly fine giant."
"It's got Douglas's face,"
"Well,"
"giant's got to have some sort of a face, hasn't it? Can't not have a face, can it?"
"Blue dog,"
"Blue dog,"
"You never saw a blue dog before, did you? No, and you aren't likely to see one again, neither. It was made blue special for this show. It's the only blue dog in the world. Folks'll be comin' from all over the world to see this blue dog--an' thrown in in a penny show! If it was in the Zoo you'd have to pay a shilling to see it, I bet.  It's--it's jus' luck for you it's here. I guess the folks at the Zoo wish they'd got it. Tain't many shows have blue dogs. Brown an' black an' white--but not blue. Why, folks pay money jus' to see shows of ornery dogs--so you're jus' lucky to see a blue dog _an'_ a dead bear from Russia _an'_ a giant, _an'_ a wild cat, _an'_ a China rat for jus' one penny."
"It's jus' paint. Henry's gate's being painted blue,"
"What's that?"
"Yes,"
"what is it? I guess you'd like to know what it is!"
"Garn! It's jus' snorin'."
"Snorin'!"
"It's not ornery snorin', that isn't. Jus' listen, that's all! You couldn't snore like that, I bet. Huh!"
"jus' couldn't help hearin'."
"You wicked boy!"
"you _wicked_, _wicked_, _wicked_ boy!"
"By Jove!"
"She's woke,"
"She's mad wild."
"Let's count the money--"
"Four an' six!"
"Four an' six! Jolly good, I _should_ say! An' it would only have been about two shillings without Aunt Emily, an' I thought of her, didn't I? I guess you can all be jolly grateful to me."
"All right,"
"I'm not envying you, am I? You're welcome to it when she tells your father."
"Will you be good enough to procure a conveyance?"
"After the indignities to which I have been subjected in this house I refuse to remain in it a moment longer."
"A crowd of vulgar little boys,"
"and horrible indecent placards all over the room."
"And me in my state of health,"
"And if this horrible thing hadn't happened, I might have stayed with you all the winter and perhaps part of the spring."
"How dreadful!"
"It's--it's _disgraceful_ of William,"
"You must speak to him."
"I will,"
"William!"
"She's told,"
"You'd better go and get it over,"
"William!"
"Go on,"
"He'll only come up for you."
"What's that horrible thing on your face?"
"Whiskers,"
"Is it true,"
"that you actually took your friends into your aunt's room without permission and hung vulgar placards around it?"
"Yes,"
"It's disgraceful,"
"_disgraceful_! That's all."
"Hello!"
"That's not taken long. What----"
"Look!"
"Crumbs! Look!"
"What can I do?"
"_Nothing!_"
"What can I do?"
"Couldn't you just sit quietly?"
"That's not _doin'_ anything,"
"I _could_ sit quietly all day,"
"if I wanted."
"But you never do."
"No, 'cause there wouldn't be any _sense_ in it, would there?"
"Couldn't you read or draw or something?"
"No, that's lessons. That's not doin' anything!"
"I could teach you to knit if you like."
"And I heard her say to him----"
"What are you doing, William?"
"Nothin',"
"Shut the door after you when you go out, won't you, William?"
"I wun't stay here now,"
"not even if--even if--even if,"
"not even if you wanted me,"
"I bet they feel _small_!"
"You see----"
"Oh, get out!"
"Can I go out?"
"No, of course not. It's pouring."
"I don't mind rain."
"Don't be silly."
"Why,"
"have they got friends in an' me not?"
"I suppose you didn't think of asking anyone,"
"Well, can I have someone now?"
"No, it's too late,"
"ten and elevenpence"
"Well, when can I?"
"William, do be quiet! Any time, if you ask. Eighteen and twopence."
"Can I have lots?"
"Oh, go and ask your father."
"If you've come to ask questions----"
"I haven't,"
"Father, when you're all away on Saturday, can I have a party?"
"No, of course not,"
"Can't you _do_ something?"
"THE SORT OF THINGS I WANT TO DO THEY DON'T WANT ME TO DO, AN' THE SORT OF THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO THEY WANT ME TO DO."
"The sort of things I want to do they don't want me to do an' the sort of things I don't want to do they want me to do. Mother said to knit.  _Knit!_"
"Thank Heaven, it's stopped raining! Go out!"
"Did you say I could have a party, father?"
"_No_, I did _not_,"
"They"
"What have I just been saying, William?"
"Was it anythin' about participles?"
"That was ever so long ago, William,"
"You've not been attending."
"Tell him, Henry."
"Two negatives make an affirmative."
"Yes. Say that, William."
"Yes. What's a negative, William?"
"Somethin' about photographs?"
"_No_,"
"It's 'no' and 'not.' And an affirmative is 'yes.'"
"Oh,"
"So two 'nos' and 'nots' mean 'yes,' if they're in the same sentence. If you said 'There's not no money in the box' you mean there is."
"Oh"
"Then,"
"if you say 'no' and 'not' in the same sentence does it mean 'yes'?"
"Certainly."
"Thank you,"
"It's all right, William,"
"I'm glad you're beginning to take an interest in your work."
"'No, of course _not_' and 'No, I did not' and a 'no' an' a 'not' mean a 'yes,' so he meant 'yes, of course' and 'yes, I did.'"
"My folks is goin' away to-morrow an' they said I could have a few fren's in to tea. Can you come? Tell your mother they said jus' to come an' not bother to write."
"He _said_ I could. He said '_Yes_, of course.' He said '_Yes_, I did.'"
"You don't mind being left, darling, do you?"
"No, mother,"
"You won't do anything we've told you not to, will you?"
"No, mother. Only things you've said 'yes' to."
"that Master William"
"You're not coming in here!"
"What've you brought all those boys cluttering up the garden?"
"They've come to tea,"
"That they've _not_!"
"What your father'd say----"
"He _said_ they could come,"
"I asked him an' he said 'Yes, of course,' an' I asked if he'd said so an' he said 'Yes, I did.' That's what he said 'cause of English Grammar an' wot Miss Jones said."
"Come on!"
"She's the enemy. Let's storm her ole castle."
"Mean ole cat!"
"Go it, ole William! Yah! He--oo--o!"
"Hide and Seek"
"not in the bedrooms, dear,"
"mind the umbrella stand,"
"certainly not in the drawing-room,"
"don't shout so loud, darling."
"Come on!"
"All jus' get what you can."
"She's coming home!"
"Don't let her come in!"
"Come on!"
"Go on! Send her into the road."
"Come and play with me, William,"
"I can't. I'm goin' to bed,"
"Why? Are you ill, William?"
"No."
"Well, why are you going to bed, William?"
"I'm goin' to bed,"
"'cause my father don't understand 'bout English Grammar, that's why!"
"William! you've been playing that dreadful game again!"
"I haven't. I haven't done anything what you said I'd not to. It was 'Lions an' Tamers' what you said I'd not to play. Well, I've not played 'Lions an' Tamers,' not since you said I'd not to. I wouldn't _do_ it--not if thousands of people asked me to, not when you said I'd not to. I----"
"Well, what _have_ you been playing at?"
"It was 'Tigers an' Tamers.'"
"It's a different game altogether. In 'Lions an' Tamers' half of you is lions an' the other half tamers, an' the tamers try to tame the lions an' the lions try not to be tamed. That's 'Lions an' Tamers'. It's all there is to it. It's quite a little game."
"What do you do in 'Tigers and Tamers'?"
"Well----"
"Well,"
"in '_Tigers_ an' Tamers' half of you is _tigers_--you see--and the other half----"
"It's exactly the same thing, William,"
"I don't see how you can call it the same thing,"
"You can't call a _lion_ a _tiger_, can you? It jus' isn't one. They're in quite different cages in the Zoo. '_Tigers_ an' Tamers' can't be 'zactly the same as '_Lions_ an' Tamers.'"
"Well, then,"
"you're never to play 'Tigers and Tamers' either. And now go and wash your face."
"My _face_?"
"My _face_? I've washed it twice to-day. I washed it when I got up an' I washed it for dinner. You told me to."
"Well, just go and look at it."
"It's no good,"
"You must wash your face and brush your hair and you'd better change your suit--and stockings. They're simply covered with dust!"
"I shouldn't think,"
"I shouldn't think there's many houses where so much washin' and brushin' goes on as in this, an' I'm glad for their sakes."
"William!"
"That's better,"
"Now, William, do just sit down here till tea-time. There's only about ten minutes, and it's no good your going out. You'll only get yourself into a mess again if you don't sit still."
"Here?"
"Well, dear--just till tea-time."
"What can I do in here? There's nothing to _do_, is there? I can't sit still and not _do_ anything, can I?"
"Oh, read a book. There are ever so many books over there you haven't read, and I'm sure you'd like some of them. Try one of Scott's,"
"charming."
"The little dear!"
"Well, my little man, and how are you?"
"I adore children,"
"Scott!"
"Dear little laddie!"
"_Do_ come and sit over here,"
"What perfect weather we're having."
"You know, I'm _frightfully_ interested in social work,"
"especially among children. I _adore_ children! Sweet little dear of yours! And I _always_ get on with them. Of course, I get on with most people. My personality, you know! You've heard perhaps that I've taken over the Band of Hope here, and I'm turning it into _such_ a success. The pets! Yes, three lumps, please. Well, now, it's here I want you to help me. You will, dear, won't you? You and your little mannikin.  I want to get a different class of children to join the Band of Hope.  Such a sweet name, isn't it? It would do the village children such a lot of good to meet with children of _our_ class."
"For instance,"
"when I came in and saw your little treasure sitting there so sweetly,"
"I thought to myself, 'Oh, I _must_ get him to come.' It's the refining influence of children in _our_ class that the village children need.  What delicious cakes. You will lend him to me, won't you? We meet once a week, on Wednesday afternoons. May he come? I'll take great care of him."
"Er--yes,"
"But I don't know that William is really suited to that sort of thing. However----"
"Oh, you can't put me off!"
"Don't I _know_ him already? I count him one of my dearest little friends. It never takes me long to know children. I'm a _born_ child-lover."
"_There_ you are!"
"I _thought_ you'd be waiting to say good-bye to me."
"I _have_ so enjoyed seeing you. I hope you'll come again,"
"Good-bye, Willy, dear. You're not too old to kiss me, are you?"
"The sweet, shy thing!"
"I _love_ them shy."
"Well,"
"I can't quite visualise William at a Band of Hope meeting; but of course, if you want him to, he must go."
"You see,"
"she made such a point of it, and she really is very charming, and after all she's rather influential. She was one of _the_ Randalls, you know. It seems silly to offend her."
"Did William like her?"
"She was sweet with him. At least--she meant to be sweet,"
"but you know how touchy William is, and you know the name he always hates so. I can never understand why. After all, lots of people are called Willy."
"Oh, William! What's the matter?"
"Gotter sick headache,"
"Oh, dear! I _am_ sorry. You'd better go and lie down. I'm so sorry, dear."
"I think I will go an' lie down,"
"I'll jus' have breakfast first."
"Oh, I wouldn't. Not with a sick headache."
"I think I could eat some, mother. Jus' a bit."
"No, I wouldn't, dear. It will only make it worse."
"'E's eat nearly everything, 'm. You never saw such a thing. 'E's eat the cold 'am and the kidney pie, and 'e's eat them three cold sausages an' 'e's eat all that new jar of lemon cheese."
"_William!_"
"you _can't_ have a sick headache, if you've eaten all that."
"'E'S EAT NEARLY EVERYTHING, MUM. 'E'S EAT THE COLD 'AM AND THE KIDNEY PIE, AND 'E'S EAT THE JAR OF LEMON CHEESE!"
"rabbiting"
"Hello! What's up?"
"I've sprained my ankle,"
"Here, sit down, old chap, and let me feel it,"
"Which is it?"
"Er--this."
"It's a pity you limped with the other,"
"I'm sure you'll enjoy it, William,"
"I expect you'll all play games and have quite a good time."
"Hey, Jumble!"
"William, you can't take a dog to a Band of Hope meeting."
"Why not?"
"I don't see why not. Dogs don't drink beer, do they? They've as much right at a Band of Hope meeting as I have, haven't they? There seems jus' nothin' anyone _can_ do."
"Well, I'm sure it wouldn't be allowed. No one takes dogs to meetings."
"I hope you'll enjoy it,"
"It's a wonder I'm not _dead_,"
"the things I have to do!"
"You goin' too?"
"Did she come to _your_ mother?"
"Gotter beas'ly throat,"
"I didn't ought to be out."
"I'm ill, too,"
"I _told_ 'em so."
"An' me,"
"An' me,"
"Cruel sorter thing, sendin' us all out ill like this."
"It's no good,"
"they'd find out."
"Dear children,"
"welcome to our little gathering. These,"
"these are our dear new friends. We must make them _so_ happy. _Dear_ children!"
"Now, girlies dear and laddies dear, what do I expect you to be at these meetings?"
"Respectful and reposeful."
"I have a name, children dear."
"Respectful and reposeful, Mrs. de Vere Carter."
"That's it, children dear. Respectful and reposeful. Now, our little new friends, what do I expect you to be?"
"You're _such_ shy darlings, aren't you?"
"You won't be shy with us long, I'm sure. We're _so_ happy here. Happy and good. Now, children dear, what is it we must be?"
"Happy and good, Mrs. de Vere Carter."
"That's it. Now, darlings, in the front row, you tell me. Willy, pet, you begin. What is it we must be?"
"You tell me then, Harry boy."
"Ah, you won't be so shy next week, will they, children dear?"
"No, Mrs. de Vere Carter,"
"Now, we'll begin with one of our dear little songs. Give out the books."
"Number five, 'Sparkling Water.' Collect your thoughts, children dear. Are you ready?"
"Now, we'll play one of our games, children dear. You can begin by yourselves, can't you, darlings? I'll just go across the field and see why little Teddy Wheeler hasn't come. He must be _regular_, mustn't he, laddies dear? Now, what game shall we play. We had 'Puss in the Corner' last week, hadn't we? We'll have 'Here we go round the mulberry-bush' this week, shall we? No, not 'Blind Man's Buff,' darling. It's a horrid, rough game. Now, while I'm gone, see if you can make these four shy darlings more at home, will you? And play quietly. Now before I go tell me four things that you must be?"
"Respectful and reposeful and happy and good, Mrs. de Vere Carter,"
"GO IT, MEN! CATCH 'EM, BEAT 'EM, KNIFE 'EM, KILL 'EM!"
"Here we go round the mulberry-bush."
"Come on, you!"
"I'll get you!"
"Gr-r-r-r-r!"
"Go it, men! Catch 'em, beat 'em, knife 'em, kill 'em."
"Respectful and reposeful,"
"happy and good,"
"laddies dear,"
"Willy"
"William!"
"I've not,"
"I've not been playing at either of them--not those what you said I'd not to."
"Then--what----?"
"It was--it was--'Tamers an' Crocerdiles,' an' we played it at the Band of Hope!"
"cooked"
"Oh! I'm _so_ glad you've come, dear. And is this the baby! The _duck_!  Well, den, how's 'oo, den? Go--o--oo."
"Oh, crumbs!"
"Oh, William,"
"Mrs. Butler's come with her baby to spend the afternoon, and we'd arranged to go out till tea-time with the baby, but she's got such a headache, I'm insisting on her lying down for the afternoon in the drawing-room. But she's so worried about the baby not getting out this nice afternoon."
"Oh!"
"Well, cook's out and Emma has to get the tea and answer the door, and Ethel's away, and I told Mrs. Butler I was _sure_ you wouldn't mind taking the baby out for a bit in the perambulator!"
"_Me?_"
"_Me?_ _Me_ take a baby out in a pram?"
"Well, dear,"
"I know it's your half holiday, but you'd be out of doors getting the fresh air, which is the great thing. It's a nice baby and a nice pram and not heavy to push, and Mrs. Butler would be _so_ grateful to you."
"Yes, I should think she'd be that,"
"She'd have a right to be that if I took the baby out in a pram."
"Now, William, I'm sure you'd like to help, and I'm sure you wouldn't like your father to hear that you wouldn't even do a little thing like that for poor Mrs. Butler. And she's got such a headache."
"_A little thing like that!_"
"All right,"
"I'll be down in a minute."
"You surely don't mean to say, mother,"
"that you're going to trust that child to--William."
"Well,"
"someone has to take him out. It's such a lovely afternoon. I'm sure it's very kind of William, on his half-holiday, too. And she's got _such_ a headache."
"Well, of course,"
"you know William as well as I do."
"Oh, dear!"
"And everything so nicely settled, Robert, and you must come and find fault with it all. If you don't want William to take him out, will you take him out yourself?"
"I don't want to take him out myself--thanks very much, all the same!  All I say is--you know William as well as I do. I'm not finding fault with anything. I simply am stating a fact."
"Here he is, dear, all ready for you, and you needn't go far away--just up and down the road, if you like, but stay out till tea-time. He's a dear little baby, isn't he? And isn't it a nice Willy-Billy den, to take it out a nice ta-ta, while it's mummy goes bye-byes, den?"
"Blab--blab--blab--blab--blub--blub--blub!"
"Oh, you shut up!"
"It beats me,"
"what people see in babies!  Scratchin' an' kickin' and blindin' folks and pullin' their hair all out!"
"Look here!"
"It's a kidnap,"
"We'll get a ransom on it."
"Dad--dad--dad--dad--dad!"
"It thinks I'm its father,"
"Well,"
"What do we do first? That's the question."
"In books,"
"they write a note to its people and say they want a ransom."
"We won't do that--not just yet,"
"Well, it's not much sense holdin' somethin' up to ransom and not tellin' the folks that they've got to pay nor nothin', is it?"
"N----oo,"
"But----"
"who's got a paper and pencil? I'm simply statin' a fact. Who's got a paper and pencil?"
"Oh, yes!"
"Go on! Write a note. Write a note without paper and pencil, and we'll all watch. Huh!"
"Well,"
"I don't s'pose they had paper and pencils in outlaw days. They weren't invented. They wrote on--on--on leaves or something,"
"Well, go on. Write on leaves,"
"We're not stoppin' you are we? I'm simply statin' a fact. Write on leaves."
"Look! Right deep down! See it? Wotcher think of that! Nearly to the bone! Pretty savage baby you've brought along,"
"I jolly well know that,"
"It's your own fault for touching it. It's all right if you leave it alone. Just don't touch it, that's all. Anyway, it's mine, and I never said you could go fooling about with it, did I? It wouldn't bite _me_, I bet!"
"Well, what about the ransom?"
"Someone can go and tell its people and bring back the ransom,"
"Who?"
"William brought it,"
"Yes, so I bet I've done my share."
"Well, what's anyone else goin' to do, I'd like to know? Go round to every house in this old place and ask if they've had a baby taken off them and if they'd pay a ransom for it back? That's sense, isn't it? You know where you got it from, don't you, and you can go and get its ransom."
"I can, but I'm not goin' to,"
"I'm simply statin' a fact. I'm not goin' to. And if anyone says I daren't,"
"I'll fight 'em for it."
"Anyway, what have we brought for the feast?"
"I knew the wood would be wet after the rain. It's to make the fire burn. That's sense, isn't it?"
"Only one thing to cook,"
"We can cook up the potatoes and the dumpling. They don't look half enough cooked. Let's put them on the floor here, and go out for adventures first. All different ways and back in a quarter of an hour."
"kidnap,"
"Any luck?"
"No."
"Same here. Let's start the old fire going."
"Ball!"
"Who's going to make that fire burn now?"
"Yes,"
"an' who's goin' to take that baby home? I'm simply statin' a fact. Who's goin' to take that baby home?"
"Well, it did it itself. It's no one else's fault, is it?"
"No, it's not,"
"But that's the sort of thing folks never see. Anyway, I'm goin' to wash its face."
"What with?"
"Goin' to wash it in that dirty stuff?"
"It's made of water--clean water--I made it myself, so I bet I ought to know, oughtn't I? That's what folks wash in, isn't it?--clean water?"
"Yes,"
"and what are we goin' to drink, I'd like to know?  You'd think that baby had got enough of our stuff--our potatoes and our apple-dumpling, an' our oil--without you goin' an' givin' it our licorice water as well."
"If you'd got to take this baby home like this,"
"you wouldn't be thinking much about drinking licorice water. I'm simply statin'----"
"Oh, shut up saying that!"
"I'm sick of it."
"I've brought a cow,"
"fetched it all the way from Farmer Litton's field--five fields off, too, an' it took some fetching, too."
"Well, what for?"
"What for! You've not read much about outlaws, I guess. They always drove in cattle from the surroundin' districks."
"Well, what for?"
"Well--er--well--to kill an' roast, I suppose,"
"Well, go on,"
"Kill it an' roast it. We're not stoppin' you, are we? Kill it an' roast it--an' get hung for murder. I s'pose it's murder to kill cows same as it is to kill people--'cept for butchers."
"kidnap,"
"Bow-wow!"
"Anyway, let's get on with the feast,"
"Feast!"
"Feast! Not much feast left! That baby William brought's used all the paraffin-oil and potatoes, and it's squashed the apple-dumpling, and William's washed its face in the licorice water."
"Yes--it looks like as if someone had washed it in licorice water--and as if it had used up all the oil and potatoes. It doesn't look like as if it would fetch much ransom. You seem to have pretty well mucked it up."
"Oh, shut up about the baby,"
"I'm just about sick of it. Come on with the fire."
"I hope that cow won't hurt the 'kidnap,'"
"Go and see, William; it's your kidnap."
"Well, an' it's Henry's cow, and I'm sorry for that cow if it tries playin' tricks on that baby."
"What are you doing to the poor little thing?"
"It's Henry's cow,"
"It hit it. Oh, go on, shut up! Do shut up."
"You brought it,"
"Can't you stop it? Not much sense taking babies about if you don't know how to stop 'em crying!"
"P'raps it's hungry,"
"Dad--dad--dad--dad--dad,"
"Keeps on thinking I'm its father,"
"Here, like some cake?"
"It's eating it,"
"Oh, come on, let's go and look at the fire,"
"Look!"
"Look at Henry's cow!  Pretty nice sort of cow you've brought, Henry. Not much sense taking cows about if you can't stop them puttin' folks' fires out."
"shoo'd off."
"feast,"
"kidnap"
"Blab--blab--blab--blab--blub--blub--Dad--dad--dad--dad--dad.  Go--o--o--o."
"I couldn't put any feelin',"
"into fightin' for that baby."
"Just help me get the potato out of its hair,"
"never mind the oil and the rest of it."
"THAT'S MY PRAM!"
"My hat! doesn't it smell funny!--and doesn't it look funny--all oil and potato and bits of cake!"
"Oh! shut up about it,"
"Bow-wow!"
"Crumbs!"
"Talk about bad luck! I'm simply statin' a fact.  Talk about bad luck!"
"That's my pram!"
"Garn! S'ours! We found it."
"Well, I left it there."
"Come on! We'll fight for it,"
"Oh, all right! Take your rotten old pram!"
"heart steeled for any fate"
"There you are!"
"I was getting quite anxious. Thank you _so_ much, dear."
"I'd simply love to have a page,"
"A wedding seems so--second-rate without a page."
"There's William,"
"You've had quite enough cake, William."
"_Enough!_"
"I've had hardly any yet. I was only jus' beginning to have some when you looked at me. It's a plain cake. It won't do me any harm. I wu'nt eat it if it'd do me any harm. Sugar's _good_ for you. Animals eat it to keep healthy. _Horses_ eat it an' it don't do 'em any _harm_, an' poll parrots an' things eat it an' it don't do 'em any----"
"Oh, don't argue, William,"
"He's got such a--_modern_ face!"
"There's something essentially mediæval and romantic about the idea of a page."
"There's nothing mediæval or romantic about William,"
"Well,"
"what about his cousin Dorita. They're about the same age, aren't they? Both eleven. Well, the _two_ of them in white satin with bunches of holly. Don't you think?  Would you mind having her to stay for the ceremony?"
"the ceremony."
"If you don't have his hair cut for a bit, he mightn't look so bad?"
"Would you like to go to Cousin Sybil's wedding?"
"No, I wu'nt,"
"Wouldn't you like to go dressed up?"
"Red Injun?"
"Er--no, not exactly."
"Pirate?"
"Not quite."
"I'd go as a Red Injun, or I'd go as a Pirate,"
"but I wu'nt go as anything else."
"A page,"
"is a mediæval and romantic idea, William. There's the glamour of chivalry about it that should appeal strongly to a boy of your age."
"WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO COUSIN SYBIL'S WEDDING?"
"NO, I WU'NT,"
"I've got a pair of lovely white silk stockings,"
"They'd do for tights, and Ethel has got a satin petticoat that's just beginning to go in one place. I should think we could make some sort of costume from that, don't you? We'll buy some more white satin and get some patterns."
"No, I won't wear Ethel's ole clothes,"
"You all jus' want to make me look ridiclus. You don't care how ridiclus I look. I shall be ridiclus all the rest of my life goin' about in Ethel's ole clothes. I jus' won't do it. I jus' won't go to any ole weddin'. No, I _don't_ want to see Cousin Sybil married, an' I jus' _won't_ be made look ridiclus in Ethel's ole clothes."
"Yah! _Page!_ Who's goin' to be a _page_? Oh, crumbs. A page all dressed up in white. _Dear_ little Willie. Won't he look swe-e-e-et?"
"Well, my little maid of honour?"
"Welcome! We're going to be such friends--you and me and William--the bride"
"and her little page and her little maid of honour. William's a boy, and he's just a _leetle_ bit thoughtless and doesn't realise the romance of it all. I'm sure you will. I see it in your dear little face. We'll have some lovely talks together."
"He'd look sweet, too, in white satin, wouldn't he?"
"He could walk between them.... We could buy some more white satin...."
"Soft mug, that,"
"Are you keen on this piffling wedding affair?"
"'cause I jolly well tell you I'm not."
"I'm teachin' it to dance,"
"an' it oughter fetch a jolly lot of money when it can dance proper. Dancin' mice do, you know. They show 'em on the stage, and people on the stage get pounds an' pounds every night, so I bet mice do, too--at least the folks the mice belong to what dance on the stage. I'm teachin' it to dance by holdin' a biscuit over its head and movin' it about. It bit me twice yesterday."
"I only caught it yesterday.  It oughter learn all right to-day,"
"She's a soppy old luny,"
"The soppiest old luny you'd see in any old place on _this_ old earth, you betcher life! She's made of sop. I wouldn't be found dead in a ditch with her--wouldn't touch her with the butt-end of a bargepole.  She's an assified cow, she is. Humph!"
"SHE'S A SOPPY OLD LUNY!"
"Those children are a _leetle_ disappointing as regards character--to a child lover like myself,"
"I've tried to sound their depths, but there are no depths to sound. There is none of the mystery, the glamour, the 'clouds of glory' about them. They are so--so material."
"I'm bein' made look ridiclus all the rest of my life,"
"I'm not givin' her no present. I know what I'd _like_ to give her,"
"Yes, and I _do_, too."
"Yes, an' I'll _die_ pretty soon, prob'ly,"
"and then p'r'aps you'll be a bit sorry, an' I shan't care."
"play quietly"
"_Play?_"
"I don't feel much like _playing_."
"_Crumbs!_"
"_You'll_ catch it,"
"Mickyth good now,"
"_He'll_ not be able to go,"
"Heth kite good now,"
"Sit down. _Quick!_"
"_We_ can't go now,"
"Here's the old sardine all togged up,"
"William! Dorita! Michael!"
"_Michael!_ Oh, the _dreadful_ child!"
"_Poor_ Micky,"
"He feelth tho thick."
"Never mind, dear,"
"the other two look sweet."
"What? Where?"
"Oh, what have they done? Oh, the _wretched_ children! And just when I wanted to feel _calm_. Just when all depends on my feeling _calm_. Just when----"
"We was walkin' round the room an' we sat down on the Chesterfield and there was this stuff on it an' it came on our clothes,"
"_Why_ did you sit down,"
"We was walkin' round an' we jus' felt tired and we sat down on the Chesterfield and there was this stuff on it an' it came on----"
"Oh, _stop_! Didn't you _see_ it there?"
"Well, we was jus' walking round the room,"
"an' we jus' felt tired and we sat----"
"_Stop_ saying that."
"Couldn't we make _cloaks_?"
"to hang down and cover them all up behind. It wouldn't take long----"
"THERE WAS THIS STUFF ON THE CHESTERFIELD, AND IT CAME ON OUR CLOTHES,"
"The carriage has been waiting a quarter of an hour already,"
"We've no time to spare. Come along, my dear. We'll continue the investigation after the service. You can't go, of course, you must stay at home now,"
"And I did so _want_ to have a page,"
"Come on,"
"I'll teach you a game I made up. It's mountaineerin'."
"You're a mug,"
"I know a mountaineering game worth ten of that old thing."
"mountain."
"Yah! Who waited at a church for someone what never came? Yah!"
"I hope you didn't get a bad cold waitin' for me on Wednesday at the church door."
"Some folks is easy had. I bet you all believed I was coming on Wednesday."
"I say, my turn for that stick with the spike."
"I say,"
"what do you think of this marriage business?"
"Dunno,"
"If I'd got to marry,"
"I'd as soon marry _you_ as anyone."
"I wu'nt mind,"
"But,"
"in ornery clothes."
"Oh, yes,"
"You betcher life.  In ornery clothes."
"'Ullo, Mr. Moss!"
"'Ullo, William!"
"Anythin' cheap to-day?"
"Twopence an ounce cheapest,"
"That's awful _dear_,"
"What isn't dear? Tell me that. What isn't dear?"
"Well, gimme two ounces. I'll pay you to-morrow,"
"Go on!"
"I get my money to-morrow. You know I get my money to-morrow."
"Cash, young sir,"
"My terms is cash. 'Owever,"
"I'll give you a few over when the scales is down to-morrow for a New Year's gift."
"Honest Injun?"
"Honest Injun."
"Well, gimme them now then,"
"They wouldn't be no New Year's gift then, would they?"
"I'll eat 'em to-day but I'll _think_ about 'em to-morrow,"
"That'll make 'em a New Year's gift."
"An' what good resolution are you going to take to-morrow?"
"Good resolution?"
"I ain't got none."
"You've got to have a good resolution for New Year's Day,"
"Same as giving up sugar in tea in Lent and wearing blue on Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race Day?"
"Yes, same as that. Well, you've got to think of some fault you'd like to cure and start to-morrow."
"Can't think of anything,"
"You think of something for me."
"You might take one to do your school work properly,"
"No,"
"that wun't be much fun, would it? Crumbs! It _wun't_!"
"Or--to keep your clothes tidy?"
"Or to--give up shouting and whistling."
"Crumbs, no!"
"Or to be perlite."
"Perlite?"
"Yes. 'Please' and 'thank you,' and 'if you don't mind me sayin' so,' and 'if you excuse me contradictin' of you,' and 'can I do anything for you?' and such like."
"Yes, I might be that,"
"Yes, I might try bein' that. How long has it to go on, though?"
"Not long,"
"Only the first day gen'rally. Folks generally give 'em up after that."
"What's yours?"
"I'm goin' to arsk 'er again,"
"Who?"
"Someone I've arsked regl'ar every New Year's Day for ten year."
"Asked what?"
"Arsked to take me o' course,"
"Take you where?"
"Where d'you want to go? Why can't you go yourself?"
"Ter _marry_ me, I means,"
"Well,"
"I wun't have asked the same one for ten years. I'd have tried someone else. I'd have gone on asking other people, if I wanted to get married. You'd be sure to find someone that wouldn't mind you--with a sweet-shop, too. She must be a softie.  Does she _know_ you've got a sweet-shop?"
"I'm goin' to be p'lite,"
"I'm goin' to be p'lite all day."
"Good mornin', Father,"
"Can I do anything for you to-day?"
"What do you want now?"
"GOOD MORNIN', FATHER,"
"I'm only bein' p'lite. It's--you know--one of those things you take on New Year's Day. Well, I've took one to be p'lite."
"I'm sorry,"
"You see, I'm not used to it. It startled me."
"Can I pass you anything, Robert?"
"Going to rain again,"
"If you'll 'scuse me contradicting of you Robert,"
"I heard the milkman sayin' it was goin' to be fine. If you'll 'scuse me contradictin' you."
"Look here!"
"Less of your cheek!"
"Seems to me no one in this house understands wot bein' p'lite is,"
"Seems to me one might go on bein' p'lite in this house for years an' no one know wot one was doin'."
"You're feeling quite well, dear, aren't you?"
"You haven't got a headache or anything, have you?"
"No. I'm bein' _p'lite_,"
"I'm quite well, thank you, Mother dear,"
"Does it hurt you much?"
"No thank you, Robert,"
"Thank you very much, Father."
"Not at all. Pray don't mention it, William. It's quite all right,"
"It's rather trying. How long does it last?"
"What?"
"The resolution."
"Oh, bein' p'lite! He said they didn't often do it after the first day."
"He's quite right, whoever he is,"
"They don't."
"He's goin' to ask her again,"
"Who ask who what?"
"Goo' mornin' Mr. Moss,"
"He's late!"
"I shall miss the train. Oh, dear! It will be the first New Year's Day I've missed in ten years."
"Them pink ones are new,"
"How much are they?"
"Eightpence a quarter. Oh, dear, I shall miss the train."
"They're very small ones,"
"You'd think they'd be less than that--small ones like that."
"Will you--will you do something for me and I'll _give_ you a quarter of those sweets."
"I'll do _anythin'_ for that,"
"Well, just stay in the shop till my nephew Bill comes. 'E'll be 'ere in two shakes an' I'll miss my train if I don't go now. 'E's goin' to keep the shop for me till I'm back an' 'e'll be 'ere any minute now. Jus' tell 'im I 'ad to run for to catch my train an' if anyone comes into the shop before 'e comes jus' tell 'em to wait or to come back later. You can weigh yourself a quarter o' those sweets."
"Well,"
"what d'you want?"
"_Please_ what d'you want?"
"Where's Uncle?"
"'Cause our Bill's ill an' can't come."
"That's all right,"
"You tell 'em that's all right. That's quite all right. See? Now, you go off!"
"Now, you go _away_! I don't _want_ you here. See? You _go away_ you little--assified cow!"
"if you don't mind me sayin' so."
"Good morning,"
"Where's Mr. Moss?"
"I can't hear a word you say,"
"Gone,"
"thank you,"
"Who's in charge?"
"Me,"
"Well, I'll have one of those bars of chocolates."
"Shillin' each,"
"They were only twopence yesterday."
"They're gone up since,"
"if you'll kin'ly 'scuse me sayin' so."
"Gone up----?"
"Have you heard from the makers they're gone up?"
"Yes'm,"
"When did you hear?"
"This mornin'--if you don't mind me saying so."
"Did you hear by post?"
"Yes'm. By post this mornin'."
"I happen to live opposite, you wicked, lying boy, and I know that the postman did not call here this morning."
"No, they came round to see me in the night--the makers did. You cou'n't of heard them,"
"It was when you was asleep. If you'll 'scuse me contradictin' of you."
"I shall certainly not pay more than twopence,"
"And I shall report this shop to the Profiteering Committee.  It's scandalous. And a pack of wicked lies!"
"They're a _shillin'_,"
"I don't want your nasty ole tuppences.  I said they was a _shillin'_."
"You--you ole _thief_!"
"if you don't mind me sayin' so."
"I'll set the police on you,"
"You wicked, blasphemous boy!"
"Please, I want two twopenny bars of chocolate."
"You can have lots for that,"
"They've gone cheap.  They've gone ever so cheap. You can take all the boxful for that,"
"An'--what else would you like? You jus' tell me that. Tell me what else you'd like?"
"Please, I haven't any more money,"
"_Money_ don't matter,"
"Things is cheap to-day. Things is awful cheap to-day. _Awful_ cheap! You can have--anythin' you like for that fourpence. Anythin' you like."
"'Cause it's New Year's Day?"
"Yes,"
"'cause it's that."
"Is it your shop?"
"Yes,"
"It's all my shop."
"I'd love to have a sweet-shop,"
"Well, you take anythin' you like,"
"_Sank_ you! Sank you ever so!"
"It's all right,"
"Quite all right.  Quite all right."
"Not at all. Don't menshun it. Not at all.  Quite all right."
"_MONEY_ DON'T MATTER,"
"THINGS IS CHEAP TO-DAY. AWFUL CHEAP!"
"'Ullo, Ginger! 'Ullo, Henry!"
"I've gotta shop,"
"Come on in an' look at it."
"Howd' you get it, William?"
"Someone gave it me,"
"I took one of them things to be p'lite an' someone gave it me. Go on,"
"Jus' help yourselves. Not at all. Jus' help yourselves an' don't menshun it."
"What yer doin' of?"
"You get out of my shop,"
"_Yer_ shop?"
"Yer bloomin' well pinchin' things out o' someone else's shop, _I_ can see. 'Ere, gimme some of them."
"You get _out_!"
"Get out _yerself_!"
"If I'd not took one to be p'lite,"
"I'd knock you down."
"Yer would, would yer?"
"Yes, an' I would, too. You get out."
"Where's Bill?"
"He's ill,"
"He couldn't come. I've been keepin' shop for you. I've done the best I could."
"I've got some money for you,"
"It's not much,"
"Thanks, William,"
"William, she's took me. She's goin' ter marry me. Isn't it grand? After all these years!"
"I'm afraid there's a bit of a mess,"
"It doesn't matter, William,"
"Nothing matters to-day. She's took me at last. I'm goin' to shut shop this afternoon and go over to her again. Thanks for staying, William."
"Not at all. Don't menshun it,"
"I think I've had enough of that bein' p'lite. Will one mornin' do for this year, d'you think?"
"Er--yes. Well, I'll shut up. Don't you stay, William. You'll want to be getting home for lunch."
"Goo'-bye,"
"Good-bye,"
"I'm afraid you'll find some things gone,"
"some boys was in."
"That's all right, William,"
"That's quite all right."
"quite all right"
"all right"
"She's--she's a real Botticelli,"
"Bottled cherry yourself!"
"She can't help having red hair, can she? No more'n you can help havin'--havin'----"
"having big ears,"
"'Eyes of blue and hair red-gold,'"
"Red-gold. I had to put that because it's got both colours in it. Red-gold, 'Eyes of blue and hair red-gold.' What rhymes with gold?"
"Cold,"
"That's jolly good, too, 'cause she has gotter cold. She was sneezing all last night."
"No. It should be something about her heart being cold.  ""
"That's jolly good!"
"It's just like what you read in real books--poetry books!"
"What would you like most in the world?"
"Suppose someone let you choose."
"White rats,"
"I'm thinking a way,"
"I've nearly got it. Just walk home with me, will you? I'll give you something when we get there,"
"I want to tell you my idea."
"white rats"
"I s'pose you're balmy on her,"
"like what folks are in books. I want 'em with long tails, mind."
"WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE MOST IN THE WORLD?"
"WHITE RATS!"
"You goin' shoppin' this mornin'?"
"You know I am,"
"Shall I come with you to carry parcels an' things?"
"What do you want?"
"I'm not going to buy you anything."
"I don't want anything,"
"I jus' want to _help_ you, that's all. I jus' want to carry your parcels for you. I--I jus' don't want you to get tired, that's all."
"All right."
"You can come and you can carry parcels, but you won't get a penny out of me."
"It's--it's awfully decent of you, William,"
"Do you feel all right? I mean, you don't feel ill or anything, do you?"
"No,"
"At least, not _jus'_ now. I feel all right jus' _now_. I feel as if I might not feel all right soon, but I don't know."
"Let's get home quickly. What have you been eating?"
"Nothing,"
"It's not that sort of not well.  It's quite diff'rent."
"What sort is it?"
"It's nuffin'--not jus' now. I'm all right jus' now."
"I can't walk any more, Ethel,"
"I'm took ill sudden."
"Don't be absurd, William,"
"Get up."
"I'm not absurd,"
"I'm took ill."
"Where do you feel ill?"
"All over,"
"Does your ankle hurt?"
"Yes--an' my knees an' all up me. I jus' can't walk. I'm took too ill to walk."
"Oh, what _are_ we going to do? It's a quarter of a mile home!"
"Anything wrong, Miss Brown?"
"Just _look_ at William!"
"He says he can't walk, and goodness knows what we're going to do."
"You feeling ill, my little man?"
"Huh!"
"That's a nice thing for _you_ to ask when you know you told me----"
"All right,"
"Well, let's see what we can do. Could you get on my back, and then I can carry you home? Give me your parcels.  That's right. No, Miss Brown. I _insist_ on carrying the parcels. I couldn't _dream_ of allowing you--well, if you're _sure_ you'd rather.  Leave me the big ones, anyway. Now, William, are we ready?"
"I CAN'T WALK ANY MORE, ETHEL,"
"I'M TOOK ILL SUDDEN!"
"It _is_ kind of you, Mr. French. I don't know what we should have done without you. I do hope he's not fearfully heavy, and I do hope he's not beginning anything infectious. Do let me take the other parcels. Won't you, really? Mother _will_ be grateful to you. It's such a strange thing, isn't it? I've never heard of such a thing before. I've always thought William was so strong. I hope it's not consumption or anything like that. How does consumption begin?"
"Oh, no,"
"Don't mention it--don't mention it. It's a pleasure--really it is. No, indeed you mustn't take the parcels. You have quite enough already. Quite enough. No, he isn't a bit heavy. Not a bit. I'm so glad I happened to come by at a moment that I could do you a service. _So_ glad!"
"Don't you think you could walk now--just a bit, William?"
"I'll help you walk."
"All right,"
"I don't mind. I'll lean on you hard, shall I?"
"Do you feel well enough?"
"Oh, yes. I can walk now, if he wants--I mean if he doesn't mind me holding on to his arm. I feel as if I was goin' to be _quite_ all right soon. I'm nearly all right now."
"Oh, dear!"
"You've run over him on your motor-cycle. I knew you'd run over somebody soon. I said when I saw you passing on it yesterday----"
"Why, Mother, Mr. French has been so kind. I can't think what I'd have done without him. William was taken ill and couldn't walk, and Mr.  French has carried him all the way from the other end of the road, on his back."
"Oh, I'm _so_ sorry! How very kind of you, Mr. French. Do come in and stay to lunch. William, go upstairs to bed at once and I'll ring up Dr.  Ware."
"No,"
"Don't bother poor Dr. Ware. I'm all right now. Honest I am. He'd be mad to come and find me all right."
"Of course you must see a doctor."
"No, I _mustn't_. You don't understand. It wasn't that kind of not wellness. A doctor couldn't of done me no good. I jus'--jus' came over queer,"
"What do you think, Mr. French?"
"Oh--er--well,"
"He _looks_ all right, doesn't he?  I--er--wouldn't bother. Just--er--don't worry him with questions.  Just--let him go about as usual. I--er--think it's best to--let him forget it,"
"Of course he's growing very fast."
"Yes. I expect it was just a sort of growing weakness,"
"But Mr. French was _splendid_!"
"simply splendid. William, I don't think you realise how kind it was of Mr.  French. I think you ought to thank him."
"Thank you very much indeed for carrying me,"
"_Two_, remember, and, with long tails!"
"Oh, he's gone,"
"I left him so comfortable on the sofa, and told him to try to sleep. Sleep is so important when you're ill. And now he's gone--he'll probably stay away till bedtime!"
"All right,"
"Be thankful for small mercies."
"_Two_, mind, an' with long tails."
"Where did you get it from?"
"A friend gave it me."
"_What_ friend?"
"Mr. French. The man what carried me when I was took ill sudden. He gave me it. I di'n't know it was goin' to go into your slipper. I wun't of let it if I'd known. An' I di'n't know it was goin' to bite your toe. It di'n't mean to bite your toe. I 'spect it thought it was me givin' it sumthin' to eat. I expect----"
"Be _quiet_! What on earth did Mr. French give you the confounded thing for?"
"I dunno. I s'pect he jus' wanted to."
"He seems to have taken quite a fancy to William,"
"He seems to have taken a spite against me,"
"How many of the wretched pests have you got?"
"They're rats,"
"White 'uns. I've only got two."
"Good Heavens! He's got _two_. Where's the other?"
"In the shed."
"Well, _keep_ it there, do you hear? And this savage brute as well. Good Lord! My toe's nearly eaten off. They ought to wear muzzles; they've got rabies. Where's Jumble? He in the shed, too?"
"No. He dun't like 'em. But I'm tryin' to _teach_ him to like 'em. I let 'em loose and let him look at 'em with me holdin' on to him."
"Yes, go on doing that,"
"Accidents sometimes happen."
"It was _horrible_!"
"It was pulling at my hair. It just sat there with its pink nose and long tail. It was perfectly _horrible_!"
"Where _is_ the wretched animal?"
"I've got it, Father,"
"Ethel di'n't understand. It was playin' with her. It di'n't mean to frighten her. It----"
"I told you not to keep them in the house."
"They weren't in the house,"
"They were outside the window. Right outside the window. Right on the sill. You can't call outside the window in the house, can you? I _put_ it outside the house.  I can't help it _comin'_ inside the house when I'm asleep, can I?"
"The next time I catch either of those animals inside this house, William,"
"I'll wring its neck."
"I can't think why you gave William such dreadful things,"
"I feel quite upset. I've got such a headache and my nerves are a wreck absolutely."
"It's bit me,"
"One of those rats what you gave me's bit me."
"I'm awfully sorry,"
"Well, you asked for rats, didn't you?"
"Yes,"
"But not savage ones. I never asked for savage ones, did I? I di'n't ask for rats what would scare Ethel and bite me, did I? I was jus' teaching it to dance on its hind legs an' holding up its front ones for it an' it went an' bit me."
"You--you'd better not--er--tell your mother or sister about your finger. I--I wouldn't like your sister to be upset any more."
"Don't you want me to let 'em know?"
"Er--no."
"Well, what'll you give me not to?"
"I'll give you half-a-crown,"
"All right!"
"If I wash the blood off an' get my hands dirty nobody'll notice."
"William, you don't look a bit well,"
"You don't feel like you did the other day, do you?"
"No, not a bit like that,"
"Someone gave me half-a-crown,"
"I jus' had to go somewhere."
"It's perfectly absurd of people,"
"to give large sums of money to a boy of William's age. It always ends this way.  People ought to know better."
"It was the half-crown what you give me."
"Don't tell them,"
"What'll you give me not to?"
"William! It's time for church."
"Tell William to kneel up and not to fidget,"
"He's took it,"
"It's mine! He took it!"
"_Sh!_"
"It's mine,"
"It's what Mr. French give me for being took ill that day, you know."
"What?"
"He gave it me for being took ill so's he could come and carry me home 'cause he was gone on you an' it's mine an' that boy's took it an' it was jus' gettin' to dance an'----"
"_Sh!_"
"I shall never look anyone in the face again,"
"I think _everyone_ was in church! And the way Ethel screamed! It was _awful_! I shall dream of it for nights. William, I don't know how you _could_!"
"Well, it's mine,"
"That boy'd no business to take it. It was gettin' to know _me_. I di'n't _mean_ it to get loose, an' get on Father's head an' scare folks. I di'n't mean it to. I meant it to be quiet and stay in my pocket. It's mine, anyway, an' that boy took it."
"It's not yours any more, my son,"
"Ethel, don't get mad at Mr. French. He di'n't mean anything! He only wanted to do sumthin' for you 'cause he was mad on you."
"It's _horrible_!"
"First you bringing that dreadful animal to church, and then I find that he's deceived me and you helped him. I hope Father takes the other one away."
"He won't,"
"He never said anything about that. The other's learnin' to be friends with Jumble in the shed. I say, Ethel, don't be mad at Mr. French. He----"
"Oh, don't _talk_ about him,"
"All right!"
"Well, I've got the other one left, anyway."
"Oh, William!"
"I'm so _sorry_."
"All right!"
"It's not your fault really. An' it's not Jumble's fault. P'r'aps he thought it was what I was tryin' to teach him to do. It's jus' no one's fault. We'll have to bury it."
"I'll do the reel buryin' service out of the Prayer Book."
"Well,"
"I've got _that_ left anyway."
"JUMBLE"
"Three windows and Mrs. Clive's cat all in one morning,"
"I didn't _mean_ to hit that cat,"
"I didn't--honest. I wouldn't go round teasin' cats. They get so mad at you, cats do. It jus' got in the way. I couldn't stop shootin' in time.  An' I didn't _mean_ to break those windows. I wasn't _tryin'_ to hit them. I've not hit anything I was trying to hit yet,"
"I've not got into it. It's jus' a knack. It jus' wants practice."
"It's a knack you aren't likely to acquire by practice on this instrument,"
"A rotten old cat!"
"a rotten old cat!--and didn't even hurt it. It--it made a fuss--jus' out of spite, screamin' and carryin' on! And windows!--as if glass wasn't cheap enough--and easy to put in. I could--I could mend 'em myself--if I'd got the stuff to do it. I----"
"Rats! Fetch 'em out!"
"Jumble."
"Hey! Jumble!"
"Good ole chap!"
"Good ole Jumble! Come on, then."
"William,"
"I do wish you'd be in time, and I do wish you'd brush your hair before you come to table."
"No, Ethel dear, I didn't know anyone had taken Lavender Cottage. An artist? How nice! William dear, _do_ sit still. Have they moved in yet?"
"Yes,"
"they've taken it furnished for two months, I think.  Oh, my goodness, just _look_ at William's hands!"
"Go and wash your hands, dear,"
"They're not dirty,"
"Well, anyway, they've been dirtier other times and you've said nothin'. I can't be _always_ washin' them, can I? Some sorts of hands get dirty quicker than others an' if you keep on washin' it only makes them worse an'----"
"And just _look_ at his boots!"
"Simply caked; and his stockings are soaking wet--you can see from here. He's been right _in_ the pond by the look of him and----"
"His _nails_,"
"Well,"
"go on telling us about the new people.  William, do hold your knife properly, dear. Yes, Ethel?"
"I've gotter dog,"
"What sort of a dog?"
"Who gave it to you?"
"No one gave it me,"
"I jus' got it. It began following me this morning an' I couldn't get rid of it. It wouldn't go, anyway. It followed me all round the village an' it came home with me. I couldn't get rid of it, anyhow."
"Where is it now?"
"In the back garden."
"Digging up my flower-beds, I suppose,"
"He's tied up all right,"
"I tied him to the tree in the middle of the rose-bed."
"The rose-bed!"
"Good Lord!"
"Has he had anything to eat?"
"Yes,"
"I found a few bits of old things for him in the larder."
"Well, you'd better take it to the Police Station this afternoon,"
"The Police Station!"
"It's not a _lost_ dog.  It--it jus' doesn't belong to anyone, at least it didn't. Poor thing,"
"It--it doesn't want _much_ to make it happy. It can sleep in my room an' jus' eat scraps."
"You'll have to take it, you know, William,"
"so be quick. You know where the Police Station is, don't you? Shall I come with you?"
"No, thank you,"
"Well,"
"here you are. Here's the Police Station."
"Hurry up with that stick or that race, whichever you like,"
"Well, go in,"
"Well, it's the Police Station,"
"Go in if you want."
"Hey! Jumbles"
"Did you take that dog to the Police Station, William?"
"Yes, father,"
"What did they say about it?"
"Nothing, father."
"I suppose I'd better spend the evening replanting those rose-trees,"
"And William gave him a _whole_ steak and kidney pie,"
"Cook will have to make another for to-morrow."
"What is that noise?"
"Listen!"
"It's upstairs,"
"It's a _dog_!"
"It's William's dog."
"I thought you said you'd taken that dog to the Police Station, William,"
"I did,"
"I did take it to the Police Station an' I came home. I s'pose it must of got out an' come home an' gone up into my bedroom."
"Where did you leave it? In the Police Station?"
"No--at it--jus' at the gate."
"Robert,"
"will you please see that that animal goes to the Police Station this evening?"
"Yes, father,"
"Beastly nuisance!"
"Look!"
"Look at how it knows one! Nice thing to send a dog that knows one like that to the Police Station! Mean sort of trick!"
"Rotten little mongrel!"
"Mongrel!"
"There jus' isn't no mongrel about _him_. Look at him! An' he can learn tricks easy as easy. Look at him sit up and beg. I only taught him this afternoon."
"Do it again,"
"Not so far back. Here! Give it me. Come on, come on, old chap! That's it! Now stay there! Stay there! Good dog! Got any more? Let's try him again."
"Trust"
"Paid for."
"Robert! Sydney Bellew's come for you."
"Blow the wretched dog!"
"We were going to walk to Fairfields and the beastly Police Station's right out of our way."
"I'll take it, Robert,"
"I will really."
"Yes, you took it this afternoon, didn't you?"
"I will, honest, to-night, Robert. Well, I couldn't, could I?--after all this."
"I don't know,"
"No one ever knows what _you_ are going to do!"
"Hurry up, old chap! We shall never have time to do it before dark, if you aren't quick."
"I'll take him, honest, Robert."
"Well,"
"you just mind you do, that's all, or I'll jolly well hear about it. I'll see _you_ do too."
"Hello, William!"
"You've had your bow and arrow took off you!"
"If I give you a dog half time,"
"will you give me your bow and arrows half time?"
"Where's your dog?"
"There's one behind me, isn't there,"
"Hey, Jumble!"
"Oh, yes, he's just come out of the ditch."
"Well,"
"I'm taking him to the Police Station and I'm just goin' on an' he's following me and if you take him off me I won't see you 'cause I won't turn round and jus' take hold of his collar an' he's called Jumble an' take him up to the old barn and we'll keep him there an' join at him and feed him days and days about and you let me practice on your bow and arrow. That's fair, isn't it?"
"All right,"
"Well?"
"I took him, Robert--least--I started off with him, but when I'd got there he'd gone. I looked round and he'd jus' gone. I couldn't see him anywhere, so I came home."
"Well, if he comes to this house again,"
"I'll wring his neck, so just you look out."
"scraps"
"Good afternoon,"
"Do you remember what you were thinking about just then?"
"Yes."
"Well, if you'll think of it again and look just like that, I'll give you anything you like. It's a rash promise, but I will."
"Daddy!"
"You'll do it again for me one day, won't you, and I'll keep my promise.  Hello!"
"Daddy!"
"It's Jumble! It _is_ Jumble! Oh, you horrid dog-stealing boy!"
"It _is_ Jumble,"
"He's called Jumble,"
"because he is a jumble. He's all sorts of a dog, you know.  This is Ninette, my daughter, and my name is Jarrow, and we've taken Lavender Cottage for two months. We're roving vagabonds. We never stay anywhere longer than two months. So now you know all about us. Jumble seems to have adopted you. Ninette, my dear, you are completely ousted from Jumble's heart. This gentleman reigns supreme."
"I _didn't_ steal him,"
"He just came. He began following me. I didn't want him to--not jus' at first anyway, not much anyway. I suppose,"
"I suppose you want him back?"
"You can keep him for a bit if you want him, can't he Daddy? Daddy's going to buy me a Pom--a dear little white Pom. When we lost Jumble, I thought I'd rather have a Pom. Jumble's so rough and he's not really a _good_ dog. I mean he's no pedigree."
"Then can I keep him jus' for a bit?"
"Oh, yes. I'd much rather have a quieter sort of dog. Would you like to come and see our cottage? It's just over here."
"Do you like Paris?"
"Never been there,"
"You funny boy. _Mais vous parlez Français, n'est-ce pas?_"
"Can you jazz?"
"I don't know,"
"I've not tried. I expect I could."
"That's it. I'll teach you at home. We'll dance it to a gramophone."
"You can kiss me if you like,"
"I don't want to, thanks,"
"Oh, you _are_ a funny boy!"
"and you look so rough and untidy. You're rather like Jumble. Do you like Jumble?"
"Yes,"
"You can have him for always and always,"
"_Now_ kiss me!"
"I'd love to see you dance,"
"You _would_ look funny."
"You've seen Pavlova, haven't you?"
"Dunno."
"You must know."
"I mustn't,"
"I might have seen him and not known it was him, mightn't I?"
"He's _such_ a funny boy, Daddy, and he can't jazz and he's never seen Pavlova, and he can't talk French and I've given him Jumble and he didn't want to kiss me!"
"Beware, young man,"
"She'll try to educate you. I know her. I warn you."
"Now just sit and think for a minute. I'll keep my promise."
"I do like you,"
"You must come again. I'll teach you heaps of things. I think I'd like to marry you when we grow up. You're so--_restful_."
"I was just dry for a subject,"
"at my wits' end, and when I saw them there, I had a Heaven-sent inspiration. Ah! here he is.  Ninette wants you to come to tea to-morrow, William. Ninette's given him Jumble. Do you mind?"
"I'm trying not to,"
"He kept us all awake last night, but I suppose we'll get used to it."
"And I made him a rash promise,"
"and I'm jolly well going to keep it if it's humanly possible. William, what would you like best in all the world?"
"I'd like my bow and arrows back out of that cupboard,"
"Don't let me down,"
"I'll pay for all the damage."
"It means that we all go once more in hourly peril of our lives,"
"Friendship."
